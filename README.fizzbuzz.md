# Lab02 - FizzBuzz

[Ctrl + Shift + V to see the rendered version of this file]

Write a C++ program that takes a positive integer n as input from the user and then uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to n.

For each number:

- If the number is divisible by **3**, print **`Fizz`**
- If the number is divisible by **5**, print **`Buzz`**
- If the number is divisible by **both 3 and 5**, print **`FizzBuzz`**
- Otherwise, print the number itself

Each output should appear on a **new line**.
